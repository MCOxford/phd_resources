# PhD Project Resources
This repository contains all the files, code an results used for the PhD thesis "Quantitative Verification of Gossip Protocols for Certificate Transparency".

## Summary of contents

* chapter-4 - PRISM models and results for chapter 4 (Modelling the Gossip Protocols)
* chapter-5 - PRISM models and results for chapter 5 (Improving our Analysis Using IDTMC Model Checking). To run PRISM for the models in this folder, you will need a forked version of PRISM which can be found [here](https://github.com/MCOxford/prism). At the moment, building IDTMCs can only be done using the explicit engine (```-ex``` option)
* chapter-6 - PRISM models and results for chapter 6 (Model Parameter Optimisation)
* python - [Python3](https://www.python.org/) source code 
	* create-prism-models - Automatically create ```.prism``` files by providing the model necessary parameters and client data
	* optimise-model - Use libraries designed for hyperparameter optimisation ([hyperopt](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt), [benderopt](https://github.com/Dreem-Organization/benderopt)) to find suggested model parameters to produce 'bad' scenarios for gossip protocol properties. The libraries apply the tree-structured Parzen estimator approach (see [Bergstra et al](https://www.lri.fr/~kegl/research/PDFs/BeBaBeKe11.pdf)). Package requirements can be found in ```requirements.txt```

The gossip protocols we analyse take inspiration from:
* [RFC6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962) (this is expected to be superseded by [RFC6962-bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis/))

Model checking was performed using the symbolic probabilistic model checker PRISM ([website](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/), [github](https://github.com/prismmodelchecker/prism)).

Code for abstracting IDMTC (as well as DTMC) models can be found [here](https://github.com/MCOxford/prism/blob/abs_test/prism/src/prism/AbstractionTest.java).
